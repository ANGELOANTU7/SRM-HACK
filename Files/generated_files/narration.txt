Hello there! I see from your lecture note that you are wondering about what a half adder is.

Well, a half adder is a basic electronic circuit that performs addition of two single binary digits (0 or 1), resulting in a sum digit and a carry digit. The sum represents the lower bit of the result of the addition, while the carry represents the higher bit.

Let me explain this further: Imagine you have two single binary digits, let's say 1 and 0. These are the numbers you want to add. The half adder will produce a sum of 1 and a carry of 0, because the sum of 1 and 0 is 1 and there is no need to carry over to the next digit.

On the other hand, if you want to add two binary digits that produce a sum of 2, like 1 and 1, the half adder will produce a sum of 0 and a carry of 1, indicating that the next column needs to be added with a carry.

Does that make sense to you? Do you have any questions or clarifications about the concept of a half adder?
